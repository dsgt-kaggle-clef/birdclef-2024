## quickstart

Install the pre-commit hooks for formatting code:

```bash
pre-commit install
```

We are generally using a shared VM with limited space.
Install packages to the system using sudo:

```bash
sudo pip install -r requirements.txt
```

We can ignore the following message since we know what we are doing:

```
WARNING: Running pip as the 'root' user can result in broken permissions and conflicting behaviour with the system package manager. It is recommended to use a virtual environment instead: https://pip.pypa.io/warnings/venv
```

This should allow all users to use the packages without having to install them multiple times.
This is a problem with very large packages like `torch` and `spark`.

Then install the current package into your local user directory, so changes that you make are local to your own users.

```bash
pip install -e .
```
